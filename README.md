# CheckersGame
This Project is to Craeate a Checkers Game between Human vs AI and AI VS AI using alpha-beta pruning, min-max algorithm and Q-learning

CHECKERS GAME:

It is a classic two-player board game, checkers also known as draughts. On an 8x8 board with the alternating shaded squares checkers is played. On the dark squares closest to them each player starts with 12 checkers. It covers the basic rules, game play objectives and strategic concepts employed by skilled players. Different variants of checkers will be discussed highlighting their unique challenges. To make this checkers gameplay using AI is an intresting thing. In this gameplay Human and alpha-beta pruning is one game and other is between two AI's  those are alpha-beta pruning, min-max algorithm and Q-learning algorithms.
The two main agents that are used here are Alpha-beta pruning Q-learning algorithm where Human vs AI and AI vs AI AS two modes of play

ALPHA-BETA PRUNING:

A method called alpha beta pruning is used in conjunction with the mini-max algorithm to minimize the total number of nodes that require assessment. Alpha & beta which stands for the greatest possible scores for the maximizing player (alpha) and minimizing player(beta). The algorithm modifies variables as the search goes on & removes game tree branches that are known to be unimportant for the outcome.

Q-LEARNING ALGORITHM:

The best action-selection strategy for a particular Markov decision process (MDP) may be found using the reinforcement learning approach known as Q-learning. Q-learningâ€™s primary objective is to learn a policy that instructs an agent on what to do in certain situations in order to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Since Q-learning is model-free, it doesn't need a model of the dynamics of the environment; instead, it learns from interactions with the environment directly. The predicted cumulative reward for carrying out a certain action in a specific state is represented by the Q-value function, which is learned by Q-learning.

CONCLUSION:

Finally, the given python code provides a basic structure for developing and using the checkers game. It consists of fundamental elements such as player agents, game logic. This project can be further modelized to compare the Q-Learning agent with other model free reinforcement agents.
